### Innovative Idea
Our idea is a web-based social media application that is centered around music. We want to be able to create an application that takes inspiration from existing applications like Last.fm and Spotify. 

Spotify is a well-known music streaming application that allows users to easily consume their favorite music creator's content and discover new music daily. Last.fm is an additional website that allows users to create an account, connect it to their Spotify account, and provide a lot more analytics than what Spotify shows its users. 

Despite Spotify and Last.fm being the go-to applications for users to stream music and learn more about their specific music taste analytics, neither of these applications have a very well-designed social portion for users to intermingle with each other. We want to add more of a social component to a similar type of application. We aim to do this by specific functionalities where users can interact with other users by listening to what they're currently listening to, sharing up-to-date current playlists, see what genres and vibes that users around you are listening to, and more!

### Data
We plan for our application to support the following categories of data:

- Audio

Audio represents the music/sound files streamed to the user at the user's discretion. Audio will be used in our application to allow users to listen to songs, podcasts, or music of their choosing as well as listen along to their friends.

- Audio descriptions

Audio on its own doesn't inform the user who its sung or spoken by, nor does it inform the user about the song, music or podcast itself. This will be used in our applications to give users a better idea of what they're listening to, who they're listening to, release date (possibly more to come). 

- Playlists

Playlists are ordered lists of songs, music, or podcasts created by the user. These will be used to give users a greater form of expression and customization regarding the music that they choose to listen to. This ensures that while discovering new songs and music is still an option, relying upon and listening to older personally curated selections remains great way for users to keep track of music, songs and podcasts they love.

- Location Data

Location data will roughly keep track of our user's current whereabouts. This data will be used to determine which other users are roughly within the one-mile radius for our 'vibe check' functionality. 

### Functionality
Our web application will use the Spotify API to create a social media application. The application will track the users playlists and what the user is listening to currently. The user will create an account and will then link his account with Spotify. Doing this will unlock options to view other profiles. The user can then recommend songs and playlists to friends or other people. We will also develop a feature that will take into account who is listening to what in a one-mile radius and determine a mood based on the data it finds.
